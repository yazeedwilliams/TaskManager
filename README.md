# TaskManager

## Introduction
This is a program that manages tasks assigned to members of a team of a small business. The user logs in and can perform various operations listed by the program. The admin user
has much more functionality than a regular user. The admin user can edit, add/remove and view tasks. They can also generate reports. The tasks are written to a text folder where the 
information of the tasks are stored. Teams within a business can use the program to track and organise tasks. The goal of this project was to help me understand lists, functions
and string handling in the Python language. 

## How to use this program
All you need to do is download an IDE that supports the Python language and then you should be able to run and test the code. 
Furthermore, you need a text editor to be able to store the information generated by the program.
